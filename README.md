Ensuring the integrity and security of flight data recording systems is crucial for upholding aviation safety and enabling rapid, cost-effective investigations of accidents and incidents. Although conventional Flight Data Recorders (FDRs) are crucial for collecting crucial data from many aircraft systems, such as flight controls, engine parameters, and other type specific systems, they have limits in terms of data storage, susceptibility to physical damage, and lack of transparency. These problems highlight the necessity for a more robust and dependable solution. This research suggests using blockchain technology into current FDR systems as a solution to address these constraints. The decentralized and tamper-proof nature of blockchain offers a reliable method for guaranteeing long-term data preservation and improved transparency. The objective is to create a system that can effectively preserve and secure flight data for the entirety of an aircraft's operational life, surpassing the capabilities of existing models. In addition, the suggested solution captures crucial operational data, including pilot identification, passenger count, and other operational characteristics. This guarantees that all data is readily accessible for trend analysis, training improvement, safety enhancements, and complete transparency.
