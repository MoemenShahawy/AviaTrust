          <p class="card-text">
              Ensuring the <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>dependability</strong> of flight data recording systems is crucial for aviation safety and comprehensive accident and incident investigations. Traditional systems, such as Flight Data Recorders (FDRs) and Solid-State Flight Data Recorders (SSFDRs), are essential but have limitations, including <em>finite data retention</em> capabilities and <em>vulnerability to physical damage</em>, which pose significant challenges for long-term data preservation and transparency.
          </p>
          
          <h5 class="mt-4">Key Challenges:</h5>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Data Retention Limits:</strong> Current regulations require FDRs to save only the last 25 hours of flight data, which is insufficient for extended trend analysis or in-depth safety evaluations.</li>
              <li><strong>Vulnerability to Damage:</strong> Physical damage to recorders can result in data loss, as seen in cases like the disappearance of Malaysian flight MH370.</li>
              <li><strong>Cost Implications:</strong> The financial impact on aviation investigations due to prolonged investigations and the reliance on traditional FDRs is significant.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5 class="mt-4">Research Motivation:</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
              The limitations of current flight data recorders, including their <em>susceptibility to physical damage</em> and <em>inadequate data transparency</em>, highlight the need for a more durable and secure data storage solution. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution with its decentralized and tamper-proof nature, ensuring data integrity and security. The motivation behind this research is to explore how blockchain can revolutionize the storage and retrieval of an aircraft's historical data, enhancing <strong>integrity</strong> and <strong>durability</strong> throughout its operational lifespan.
          </p>
          
          <h5 class="mt-4">Problem Statement:</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
              Traditional flight data recorders can only store the most recent 25 hours of data, leading to the overwriting of older data. This limitation poses significant challenges during accident investigations, as crucial historical data may be unavailable. Additionally, the reliance on the aircraft's technical log, which may omit minor resolved issues, further complicates investigations. The division of data across operators obstructs the ability to recognize industry-wide safety issues, hindering comprehensive safety enhancements.
          </p>
          
          <h5 class="mt-4">Research Aim:</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
              The primary aim of this research is to develop a <strong>blockchain-based flight data preservation system</strong> that overcomes the limitations of traditional flight data recorders. This system will ensure the secure, unalterable, and complete preservation of flight data throughout an aircraft's lifespan. Additionally, by recording pilot command history, it will provide insights into pilot performance over their careers, supporting airlines in refining training programs. The approach aims to improve <strong>data integrity</strong>, <strong>transparency</strong>, and <strong>availability</strong> by leveraging the decentralized characteristics of blockchain technology.
